Our performance begins
%
The stage is set
%
I suppose I must make do with this tawdry setting
%
This stage is beneath my talent, but I shall elevate it
%
I will bring them an opera of death
%
And now, the curtain rises
%
You will be poetry
%
You will be beautiful
%
Watch my puppets dance
%
This is your curtain call
%
Your life had no value before me
%
I feel inspired
%
Art is worth the pain
%
Beauty is pain
%
I will make you famous
%
You will perform
%
This is my love
%
Each bullet is a song
%
Each bullet will be a dance
%
How can we make this fresh
%
Fabulous
%
Smiles, everyone, smiles
%
Places, please
%
Delightful
%
Alright
%
Wonderful
%
The composition needs something
%
Sublime
%
Transcendent
%
Divine
%
Darling
%
Precious
%
Symmetry is so boring
%
I've outdone myself this time
%
When they find you, they will cry
%
I will touch your heart
%
They're gonna live, until they die
%
This is my calling
%
Places everyone, places
%
Shall we dance
%
Sing for me
%
I rehearsed this
%
There is no drama in a peaceful death
%
Dance for me
%
Right. On. Cue
%
Inspired
%
The show never ends
%
How lovely
%
Center stage
%
I couldn't miss your performance
%
The work is what matters
%
Art requires a certain cruelty
%
The end is important in all things
%
My audience awaits
%
I must wait until the composition is perfect
%
They're puppets. I pull their strings, and then they dance
%
My genius will be understood - eventually
%
Art must exist beyond reason
%
They call me mad. All artists are mad
%
I will not suffer this ugliness
%
I cannot be good. I must be perfection
%
Every element must be in place
%
I'm misunderstood. Beauty can't be evil
%
This performance needs more... zazz
%
It's so difficult to work under these conditions
%
My talent justifies all actions
%
I am at my best only during the performance
%
I am pure. My work is pure
%
My theater is the mind
%
Art should terrify
%
No poet's words could match my craft
%
Death should never be quick. It should be an opera
%
I shall choreograph this affair
%
What sweet sadness is killing
%
The world is cruel. It does not have to be ugly
%
Everyone wears a mask. I just chose to create my own
%
This art is a compulsion. I cannot resist it
%
Perfection isn't good enough
%
Behind every mask... is another mask
%
There is nothing for me but this
%
I never hurt anyone. It is the performance that kills
%
Until they stop me, I will keep going
%
I am the singer without a voice. The dancer without legs
%
Only to the audience do I show my true face
%
Each bullet is a piece of my soul. Each shot is a piece of me
%
I swear each performance is the last, but I lie every time
%
I am a slave to this passion
%
My work asks questions, it never has answers
%
Which is the lie? The mask, or my face
%
An icon doesn't have to explain himself
%
I wonder what they think when they see me
%
Yes, the gun is ironic
%
I like a violent composition
%
This would be easier if blood came in more colours
%
Let's start the show
%
The ecstasy of opening night
%
Smiles and screams, I bring both
%
If I keep getting interrupted, how can I be expected to work
%
I was paid to put on a killer show
%
My clients expect the best
%
They will dance, they will sing, they will die
%
A costume, some makeup, a spray of blood
%
It's very simple - when I shoot, they dance
%
My critics are... usually short-lived
%
If I get this outfit dirty, I'm going to be so annoyed
%
I serve a discerning clientele
%
Death is certain, but killing doesn't have to be ugly
%
I provide catharsis for my clients, and my victims
%
I... orchestrate death
%
I get nervous before every performance, but I need that feeling
%
The moment before the shot... is painful
%
It is only when the gun fires that I am alive
%
Mmm... the ecstasy of killing
%
The trigger on a loaded weapon... it whispers for us to act
%
I can't live without the euphoria of performance
%
Happiness... is a warm gun
%
I want to feel everything. The gun makes it so I do
%
I envy silence... because I must be loud
%
You lack imagination
%
I have elaborate plans for you
%
Killing you will be one of my finest works
%
You are mediocrity. My genius will supplant you
%
Only my actions will make you memorable
%
It hurts so good..
%
You... inspire me
%
You will learn what beauty truly is
%
Through my work, you shall transcend
%
Smile! Everyone is watching
%
Breathe in the atmosphere
%
Bliss comes only in the moment before I fire
%
There is art here, waiting
%
I inspire action
%
One, two, three, four, two, two, three, four
%
This... passion... compels me
%
Now that is what I want to see
%
Art shall blossom from your fear
%
Life has no meaning, but your death shall
%
I live for the applause, you will die for it
%
I knew you would find your mark, eventually
%
You've awoken something deep inside me
%
Face the crowd, and bleed for them
%
The face of your killer is identical to mine
%
With my technique, killing blooms into artwork
%
The Stars are watching us
%
The curtain rises on a young and vibrant universe. An audience worthy of my talent
%
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
%
Mmm, my art transcends creation
%
There is beauty here, hidden beneath existence
%
Oh to create, to destroy, these alone mean nothing
%
What is a God, without words to fear him
%
This hunger is my obsession
%
My stage is the endless abyss
%
The dark star demands perfection
%
Space is not silent, it dances, and it... screams
%
The universe will end, but I will make it wondrous
%
Art should devour us all
%
I provide the gift of a dazzling...extinction
%
Why erase everything at once, when it can be savored
%
I am the artist and I am starving
%
There is a certain elegance, in annihilation
%
Absence is the only untainted perspective
%
Existence, is agonizing
%
I must keep working
%
I can see them all, these infinite astral workings
%
Eternity, molded by my hand
%
All the stars in the sky
%
A single bullet to shatter the mirror of my own godhood
%
That moment of collapse. Ah, beautiful
%
All of you are my children, the children of silent gods
%
I want to feel everything, and then nothing
%
Destroying galaxies is a pedestrian interpretation, I paint upon the canvas of eternity
%
What do I erase? Myself, in every performance
%
Oceans of formless time open before me and they whisper, Jhin, we are your true face
%
The stars are my eyes, and one by one, I must blind them
%
Mortals and their linear time, they appreciate my art, they have no choice
%
What lies beneath my mask? The universe, as I, was meant to make it
%
Just a snap of the wrist... and everything's gone
%
You are all dancing in the palm of my hand
%
This is but a fragment of infinity
%
You are not separate from all that is
%
I inspire everything
%
I must erase everything, the audience demands it
%
How close you are to divinity
%
Where will we spend eternity
%
We are alone now, the stars and I
%
This is the road to paradise
%
Don't close your eyes, I want you to see
%
You fear erasure, but that's why I chose you
%
Art springs eternal
%
I must fill this emptiness
%
Entropy cannot be reasoned with
%
If only you could see what you'll become
%
In an endless abyss, there is only yo
%
From your dust all things are possible
%
Oh, to be one... with eternity
%
You have gone, beauty is all that remains
%
Who are you now, what will you become
%
But... how does it... fee
%
Erasure is the pinnacle of art
%
This is the providence of god
%
The final fated moment before the curtain falls
%
In darkness, I dream of a cold and silent world
%
I am the black tongue, a God without his throne, my mouth opens, and the stars pour i
%
Divinity cannot be censored
%
My performance begins anew
%
Even if the artist dies, his contributions persist in all things
%
